### What is Zling?
Zling is a guild-channel based messaging application meant for everyone - from a small
friend group or gaming community to a large corporate messaging hive. Zling is
built on robust and emerging web technologies to remain usable and deployable
anywhere you want, with as much control over your data as you want. Controlling
bloat and tuning performance is as much a priority as security and privacy.

Zling puts an emphasis on being software before being a service. Anyone can run
Zling in the way they want and not have to associate themselves with our
branding. We're not here to tell you how you *should* run your chat platform.

### What is Zvelte?
**Zvelte** is the official web client for the Zling messaging application. You
can use Zvelte on any modern browser that supports JavaScript and WebRTC (for voice
& video chat).

Zvelte is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (duh!), one of the most
admired and desired web frameworks of [StackOverflow's 2023 developer
survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-admired-and-desired).
We chose Svelte because it is lightweight
([~6.7kB](https://bundlephobia.com/package/svelte@4.2.2)), performant and great
for developer experience.

Zvelte should maintain full API coverage of the [Zling API](https://github.com/zlingapp/server), and remain a first-class application when developing components of Zling. This is one of the main apps that users of Zling interact with.

### Quickstart
üöß Zling and Zvelte are currently under development, and do not have a stable release out yet. You are free to self-host the [Zling API Server](https://github.com/zlingapp/server) and this app yourself.

#### Set up build environment
We prefer to use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as a package manager because it's fast.
Linux is recommended for a development and building OS as it simplifies
installing a lot of dependencies.
##### 1. Install Bun
See Bun's [Installation Guide](https://bun.sh/docs/installation). You can also
use a different package manager like `npm` or `yarn`, but Bun is strongly
recommended.
```sh
# check if it works
$ bun --version
1.0.7
```

##### 2. Install Packages
This installs some needed JS development libraries. Should take about a second
to finish...
```sh
$ bun install
```
